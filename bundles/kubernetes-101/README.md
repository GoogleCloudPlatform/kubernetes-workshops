You will receive an automated email with  personalized links to the surveys.

### For GDEs and All Other Content Bundle Users

Answer a couple of questions before the workshop through [this survey](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1CJ4Q0Ai8R84dHazOV5rNH34nFyWOGiEk7lthQudbKpA/).
 
Take the final survey after the workshop to [evaluate](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1689NhgwHNfhd6p8dOSlc6xHBU3OR-OBbapGJp6PHHps/edit) the content.
