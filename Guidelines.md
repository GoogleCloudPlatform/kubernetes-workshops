# Workshop Authoring Guidelines

Workshops should consist of two primary pieces:

1. A README.md.
2. Link to public Google Slides deck.

## README.md

This is the core "lab" section of the workshop. This will contain all
the steps and commands needed to complete the module. The lab should
be concise and easy to skim to the actions you need to take. Feel
free to have explanatory text, but limit text using:

* Donâ€™t cover information not relevant to the actual commands or
  activities being run in the workshop. Avoid notes directing people
  to other places, etc.
* Try to guide people through one known good path leading to where we
  are going, not covering all the options for alternate paths.
* Text should have limited explanation of new concepts to
  progress through the workshop.

## Slides

The slides are supplemental to completing the module, but essential to
learning the concepts. This is where the teaching part of the workshop
happens. Here you can explain in more detail the actions of the
workshop, have diagrams of the deployment, and explain concepts.

## Orthogonal

The lab and slides should be somewhat orthogonal, One could go through
the lab successfully on its on, but maybe not understand fully what is
happening. Also, one could present the slides on their own as a lecture
to teach the concepts and architecture explored in the workshop
module.

# Delivery Guidelines

* The workshop modules can be put together in various combinations, so
  you'll need your own introduction and agenda slides.
* Create a slack channel for the workshop to allow feedback and collaboration.
* People can create github issues and/or PRs during the event.
